// Old .back-button and .action-buttons-container rules removed.

// .top-bar-container and .top-bar-action-buttons styles removed as layout is now handled by global .page-button-panel.

// .top-bar-back-button class is available if needed for specific styling,
// but may not need styles if ReusableButtonComponent's default is fine.
// This comment can also be removed if not relevant anymore.
